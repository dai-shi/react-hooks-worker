React custom hooks for web workers.

## Introduction

Web Workers are another thread from the main thread in browsers.
We can run heavy computation in a separate thread so that
users don't feel slowing down.

React provides a reactive system.
This library hides the async nature of Web Workers with React custom hooks.
Results returned by Web Workers are stored in a React local state.

Developers can implement a worker as:

-   sync function
-   async function
-   sync generator function
-   async generator function

## Install

```bash
npm install react-hooks-worker
```

## Usage

slow_fib.worker.js:

```javascript
import { exposeWorker } from 'react-hooks-worker';

const fib = i => (i <= 1 ? i : fib(i - 1) + fib(i - 2));

exposeWorker(fib);
```

app.js:

```javascript
import React from 'react';

import { useWorker } from 'react-hooks-worker';

const createWorker = () => new Worker('./slow_fib.worker', { type: 'module' });

const CalcFib = ({ count }) => {
  const { result, error } = useWorker(createWorker, count);
  if (error) return <div>Error: {error}</div>;
  return <div>Result: {result}</div>;
};

const App = () => (
  <div>
    <CalcFib count={5} />
  </div>
);
```

## Bundler support requirements

This library requires a bundler to recognize Web Worker properly.
Not everything is tested, and we appreciate for your help.
(So far, only tested with worker-plugin.)

### Webpack

-   [worker-plugin](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/worker-plugin) ✅
-   [worker-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/worker-loader)

### Parcel

Parcel allow your Web Worker script to be automatically bundled.

### Rollup

-   [rollup-plugin-off-main-thread](https://github.com/surma/rollup-plugin-off-main-thread)
-   [rollup-plugin-web-worker-loader](https://github.com/darionco/rollup-plugin-web-worker-loader)

## API

<!-- Generated by documentation.js. Update this documentation by updating the source code. -->

### exposeWorker

expose worker

You can expose any function that returns:

-   A value
-   A promise
-   An iterable
-   An async iterable

#### Parameters

-   `func` **function (data: any): any** 

#### Examples

```javascript
import { exposeWorker } from 'react-hooks-worker';

const fib = (i) => (i <= 1 ? i : fib(i - 1) + fib(i - 2));

exposeWorker(fib);
```

### useWorker

use worker

The createWorker function should be stable to keep the worker running.
If it's referentially changed, it will create a new worker and terminate the old one.

#### Parameters

-   `createWorker` **function (): [Worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript)** 
-   `input` **any** 

#### Examples

```javascript
import { useWorker } from 'react-hooks-worker';

const createWorker = () => new Worker('./slow_fib.worker', { type: 'module' });

const CalcFib = ({ count }) => {
  const { result, error } = useWorker(createWorker, count);
  if (error) return <div>Error: {error}</div>;
  return <div>Result: {result}</div>;
};
```

## Examples

The [examples](examples) folder contains working examples.
You can run one of them with

```bash
PORT=8080 npm run examples:01_minimal
```

and open <http://localhost:8080> in your web browser.
